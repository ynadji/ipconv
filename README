I got sick of googling "ip address to hex" in google and entering stuff in there, so I wrote this. Converts IPv4
addresses from: dotted quad, hex, decimal, and binary to all the others.

% ipconv 192.168.2.1 3442236033

Hex:       0xc0a80201
Decimal:   3232236033
Quad:      192.168.2.1
Binary:    0b11000000101010000000001000000001

Hex:       0xcd2c5a81
Decimal:   3442236033
Quad:      205.44.90.129
Binary:    0b11001101001011000101101010000001
